      <h4>About Us</h4>

      <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency is
        government's obligation to share information with citizens.
        It is at the heart of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at USA Open Gov we believe that
        government should be transparent.
        <br>
        <br>
        Governments exist to serve the people.
        Information on how officials conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and
        easily understood. This transparency allows good and just governance.
        Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
        <br>
        <br>
        We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
        effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions.
        Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
        knowledge.
        We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American government.
        <br>
        <br>
        USA Open Gov works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use.
        We solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.

      <p v-show="readMore">Background History of Government Transparency In the West, the idea that government should be
        open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment,
        when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual
        project.
        The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for
        example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part
        of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766).
        This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the
        eighteenth-century public sphere.
        <br>
        <br>
        Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press
        enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional
        articles.
        In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously
        opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the
        latter.
        <br>
        <br>
        Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to
        the passing of freedom of information legislation.
        Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the originsof
        its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining
        independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation
        in 1999).
        The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs)
        or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
